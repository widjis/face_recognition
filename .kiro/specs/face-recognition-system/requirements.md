# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a face recognition system that uses embedding vectors for similarity search and reranking to identify and match faces in images. The system will extract facial features into high-dimensional vectors, perform efficient similarity searches, and use reranking techniques to improve match accuracy and relevance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to extract facial embeddings from images, so that I can represent faces as numerical vectors for comparison.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image containing a face is provided THEN the system SHALL extract a facial embedding vector
2. WHEN multiple faces are present in an image THEN the system SHALL extract separate embedding vectors for each detected face
3. WHEN no face is detected in an image THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
4. WHEN the embedding extraction fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to store and index facial embeddings efficiently, so that I can perform fast similarity searches across large datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a facial embedding is generated THEN the system SHALL store it in a vector database with associated metadata
2. WHEN storing embeddings THEN the system SHALL maintain an index for efficient similarity search
3. WHEN the vector database reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL handle storage gracefully
4. WHEN duplicate embeddings are stored THEN the system SHALL handle them according to configured policy

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform similarity search on facial embeddings, so that I can find the most similar faces in the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a query embedding is provided THEN the system SHALL return the top-k most similar embeddings
2. WHEN performing similarity search THEN the system SHALL use cosine similarity or equivalent distance metric
3. WHEN no similar faces are found above a threshold THEN the system SHALL return an empty result set
4. WHEN similarity search is performed THEN the system SHALL return results within acceptable time limits (< 1 second for datasets up to 100k faces)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to rerank similarity search results, so that I can improve the accuracy and relevance of face matches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN similarity search results are obtained THEN the system SHALL apply reranking algorithms to improve result quality
2. WHEN reranking is performed THEN the system SHALL consider additional features beyond basic embedding similarity
3. WHEN reranking is complete THEN the system SHALL return results ordered by improved relevance scores
4. WHEN reranking fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to original similarity search results

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure similarity thresholds and search parameters, so that I can tune the system for different use cases and accuracy requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the system SHALL allow setting similarity thresholds for matching
2. WHEN configuring search parameters THEN the system SHALL allow setting the number of results to return
3. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL validate parameters and return appropriate errors
4. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL apply them without requiring restart

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to handle various image formats and preprocessing, so that the system can work with different input sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images in common formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP) are provided THEN the system SHALL process them successfully
2. WHEN images require preprocessing (resizing, normalization) THEN the system SHALL handle this automatically
3. WHEN invalid or corrupted images are provided THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
4. WHEN images are too small or low quality THEN the system SHALL provide quality warnings

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to batch process multiple images, so that I can efficiently handle large datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple images are provided for processing THEN the system SHALL handle them in batch mode
2. WHEN batch processing is performed THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates
3. WHEN errors occur during batch processing THEN the system SHALL continue processing remaining items and report errors
4. WHEN batch processing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of results and any failures
